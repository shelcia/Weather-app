### General Rules :
These are in general rules that you should be following while contributing to an Open Source project :

- Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR)
- Check if the Issue you created, exists or not.
- Make proper commit messages and document your PR well.
- Always add Comments in your Code and explain it at points, if possible add Doctest.
- Always create a Pull Request from a Branch; Never from the Master.
- Follow proper code conventions because writing clean code is important.
- Issues would be served on a "First Come, First Serve" basis.
- Do mention (@maintainer) the project maintainer if your code PR isn't reviewed within 2 days.

# Submitting Contributionsüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª  
Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.  
## Step 0 : Identify what you want to contribute.
- If you want to add or change a major feature, create an issue and discuss with the maintainer what you would like to change.
- If you want to work on an Existing Issues or an Issue that you created, check if anyone is working on that issue.
- If no one is working on the issue, just comment and start working on it otherwise wait for the Issue to be assigned to you.

## Step 1 : Fork the Project  
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.  
```  
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>  
$ cd Weather-app
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/shelcia/Weather-app.git
```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.  
```  
$ git remote update  
$ git checkout <branch-name>  
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>  
```  
## Step 2 : Branch 
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.  
```  
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
$ git checkout -b branch_name  
```  

## Step 3 : Work Remotely  
- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
### Environment Setup and Local Installation:
* Drop a :star: on the Github Repository.

* Download any IDE/ text editor, some of the recommended ones:
	[Install VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
	[Install Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

* Download [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
or 
Run 
```
npm install
```

* Use this commands in your terminal for using the project.
```

```

* Open the project in your IDE/ text editor to use it.


## Step 4 : Work on the feature/ issue.  
- Add all the files/folders needed.  
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:  
```  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
$ git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
$ git add <some files>
```

## Step 5 : Commit  
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:  
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
$ git commit -m "message"  
```  

## Step 6 : Upload your changes   
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:  
  
```  
# To push your work to your remote repository  
$ git push -u origin Branch_Name  
```  
- Here is how your branch will look in the fork.
